== Current Project

- Stochastic First-order Methods for Nonsmooth Nonconvex Optimization
-- We check the convergence performances of some first-order methods like stochastic gradient/mirror descent in nonsmooth nonconvex optimization.
-- We try to relax existing assumptions and some algorithms settings to see whether these algorithms can still converge.
-- We try to apply existing convergence results to more optimization problems

== Past Projects

- Asynchronous Multi-Task Learning (AMTL)
-- We tried to apply "Asynchronous Parallel Stochastic Gradient Methods" to Multi-Task Learning (MTL) problems.
-- My project aims to implement a prototype of this new learning framework. The main tools used are Java, Socket and some [http://www.netlib.org/blas/ BLAS]. The code is available on [https://github.com/illidanlab/AMTL GitHub].
-- I worked on this project during the summer of 2016, in [https://cmse.msu.edu/ the Department of CMSE] of [https://msu.edu/ MSU], supervised by [http://users.math.msu.edu/users/yanm/index.html Prof. Ming Yan] and [http://jiayuzhou.github.io/ Prof. Jiayu Zhou]
