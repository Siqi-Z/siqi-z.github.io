- Asynchronous Multi-Task Learning (AMTL)
-- Multi-Task Learning (MTL) is a different learning framework from single task learning in the training process, multiple tasks are performed simultaneously to capture intrinsic relatedness.
-- Based on the theory from "Asynchronous Parallel Stochastic Gradient Methods", MTL is asynchronized, evolving into AMTL, forward-backward operator is applied in the new algorithm framework.
-- My project aims to implement a prototype of this new learning framework. The main tools used are Java, Socket and some [http://www.netlib.org/blas/ BLAS]. The code is available [https://github.com/illidanlab/AMTL here].
-- I am engaged into this project during the summer of 2016, in [https://cmse.msu.edu/ the Department of CMSE] of [https://msu.edu/ MSU], supervised by [https://cmse.msu.edu/directory/faculty/ming-yan/ Dr. Ming Yan] and [http://0xmachine.com/ Dr. Jiayu Zhou]
